# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview of the analysis

This project aims to evaluate and determine the number of retiring employees and their respective titles who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program proposed by the Pewlett Hackard company.
To achieve this, I have used the PostgreSQL system to develop a code to complete my analysis and create a SQL Database to provide critical information such as The Number of Retiring Employees by Title and The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program. Therefore, this analysis will generate data supporting the manager in providing a strong recommendation to  employees closed to reach retirement age and benefit from the silver Tsunami program.
