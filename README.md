# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview of the analysis

This project aims to evaluate and determine the number of retiring employees and their respective titles who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program proposed by the Pewlett Hackard company.
To achieve this, I have used the PostgreSQL system to develop a code to complete my analysis and create a SQL Database to provide critical information such as The Number of Retiring Employees by Title and The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program. Therefore, this analysis will generate data supporting the manager in providing a strong recommendation to  employees closed to reach retirement age and benefit from the silver Tsunami program.
### Actual Storage Data
The current database of the company consists of six different CSV files that contain relevant employment information. The diagram below represents the current dataset and its relationship.

The following query codes were written to compile and filter the information required for the analysis based on the data available:

- No. of retiring employees by title from January 1st, 1952 to December 31st, 1955

The output of the code above is the generation of  three different CSV dataset: (a) retirement_titles; (b) unique_titles, and (c) retiring_titles.

- Mentorship Eligibility program for current employees born between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965
